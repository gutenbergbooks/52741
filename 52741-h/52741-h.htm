<h2><a name="HOW_TO_TELL_FORTUNES_BY_CARDS" id="HOW_TO_TELL_FORTUNES_BY_CARDS">HOW TO TELL FORTUNES<br />
<span class="largefont">BY CARDS.</span></a></h2>


<p>In telling Fortunes by Cards&mdash;as in all games in which they
are employed&mdash;the Ace ranks highest in value. Then comes
the King, followed by the Queen, Knave, Ten, Nine, Eight, and
Seven; these being generally the only cards used.</p>

<p>The order, and comparative value of the different suits, is as
follows:&mdash;First on the list stand “Clubs,” as they mostly portend
happiness; and&mdash;no matter how numerous, or how accompanied&mdash;are
rarely or never of bad augury. Next come
“Hearts,” which usually signify joy, liberality, or good temper;
“Diamonds,” on the contrary, denote delay, quarrels, and annoyance;
and “Spades”&mdash;the worst suit of all&mdash;grief, sickness,
and loss of money.</p>

<p>We are of course speaking generally, as, in many cases, the
position of cards entirely changes their signification; their individual
and relative meaning being often widely different.
Thus, for example, the King of Hearts, the Nine of Hearts, and
the Nine of Clubs, respectively signify, a liberal man, joy, and
success in love, but change their position, by placing the King
<em>between</em> the two nines, and you would read that a man, then
rich and happy, would be ere long consigned to a prison!</p>


<h3>SIGNIFICATION OF THE CARDS.</h3>

<p>The individual meaning attached to the thirty-two cards employed
is as follows:&mdash;</p>


<h3>THE EIGHT CLUBS.</h3>

<p><em>Ace of Clubs.</em>&mdash;Signifies joy, money, or good news; if reversed,
the joy will be of brief duration.</p>

<p><em>King of Clubs.</em>&mdash;A frank, liberal man, fond of serving his friends;
if reversed, he will meet with a disappointment.</p>

<p><em>Queen of Clubs.</em>&mdash;An affectionate woman, but quick-tempered
and touchy; if reversed, jealous and malicious.</p>

<p><em>Knave of Clubs.</em>&mdash;A clever and enterprising young man; reversed,
a harmless flirt and flatterer.</p>

<p><em>Ten of Clubs.</em>&mdash;Fortune, success, or grandeur; reversed, want of
success in some small matter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p><em>Nine of Clubs.</em>&mdash;Unexpected gain, or a legacy; reversed, some
trifling present.</p>

<p><em>Eight of Clubs.</em>&mdash;A dark person’s affections, which, if returned,
will be the cause of great prosperity; reversed, those of a
fool, and attendant unhappiness, if reciprocated.</p>

<p><em>Seven of Clubs.</em>&mdash;A small sum of money, or unexpectedly recovered
debt; reversed, a yet smaller amount.</p>


<h3>THE EIGHT HEARTS.</h3>

<p><em>Ace of Hearts.</em>&mdash;A love-letter, or some pleasant news; reversed,
a friend’s visit.</p>

<p><em>King of Hearts.</em>&mdash;A fair, liberal man; reversed, will meet with
disappointment.</p>

<p><em>Queen of Hearts.</em>&mdash;A mild, amiable woman; reversed, has been
crossed in love.</p>

<p><em>Knave of Hearts.</em>&mdash;A gay young bachelor, who dreams only of
pleasure; reversed, a discontented military man.</p>

<p><em>Ten of Hearts.</em>&mdash;Happiness, triumph; if reversed, some slight
anxiety.</p>

<p><em>Nine of Hearts.</em>&mdash;Joy, satisfaction, success; reversed, a passing
chagrin.</p>

<p><em>Eight of Hearts.</em>&mdash;A fair person’s affections; reversed, indifference
on his or her part.</p>

<p><em>Seven of Hearts.</em>&mdash;Pleasant thoughts, tranquillity; reversed, ennui,
weariness.</p>


<h3>THE EIGHT DIAMONDS.</h3>

<p><em>Ace of Diamonds.</em>&mdash;A letter, soon to be received; and, if the card
be reversed, containing bad news.</p>

<p><em>King of Diamonds.</em>&mdash;A fair man&mdash;generally in the army&mdash;but
both cunning and dangerous; if reversed, a threatened danger,
caused by machinations on his part.</p>

<p><em>Queen of Diamonds.</em>&mdash;An ill-bred, scandal-loving woman; if reversed,
she is to be greatly feared.</p>

<p><em>Knave of Diamonds.</em>&mdash;A tale-bearing servant, or unfaithful
friend; if reversed, will be the cause of mischief.</p>

<p><em>Ten of Diamonds.</em>&mdash;Journey, or change of residence; if reversed,
it will not prove fortunate.</p>

<p><em>Nine of Diamonds.</em>&mdash;Annoyance, delay; if reversed, either a family
or a love quarrel.</p>

<p><em>Eight of Diamonds.</em>&mdash;Love-making; if reversed, unsuccessful.</p>

<p><em>Seven of Diamonds.</em>&mdash;Satire, mockery; reversed, a foolish scandal.</p>

<p>N. B.&mdash;In order to know whether the Ace, Ten, Nine, Eight
and Seven of Diamonds are reversed, it is better to make a small
pencil-mark on each, to show which is the top of the card.</p>


<h3>THE EIGHT SPADES.</h3>

<p><em>Ace of Spades.</em>&mdash;Pleasure; reversed, grief, bad news.</p>

<p><em>King of Spades.</em>&mdash;The envious man, an enemy, or a dishonest
lawyer, who is to be feared; reversed, impotent malice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<p><em>Queen of Spades.</em>&mdash;A widow; reversed, a dangerous and malicious
woman.</p>

<p><em>Knave of Spades.</em>&mdash;A dark, ill-bred young man; reversed, he is
plotting some mischief.</p>

<p><em>Ten of Spades.</em>&mdash;Tears, a prison; reversed, brief affliction.</p>

<p><em>Nine of Spades.</em>&mdash;Tidings of a death; reversed, it will be some
near relative.</p>

<p><em>Eight of Spades.</em>&mdash;Approaching illness; reversed, a marriage
broken off, or offer refused.</p>

<p><em>Seven of Spades.</em>&mdash;Slight annoyances; reversed, a foolish intrigue.</p>

<p>The Court cards of Hearts and Diamonds usually represent
persons of fair complexion; Clubs and Spades, the opposite.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Signification of Different Cards of the Same Denomination.</span></h3>

<p><em>Four Aces</em>, coming together, or following each other, announce
danger, failure in business, and sometimes imprisonment.
If one or more of them be reversed, the danger will be
lessened, but that is all.</p>

<p><em>Three Aces</em>, coming in the same manner.&mdash;Good tidings; if reversed,
folly.</p>

<p><em>Two Aces.</em>&mdash;A plot; if reversed, will not succeed.</p>

<p><em>Four Kings.</em>&mdash;Rewards, dignities, honors; reversed, they will be
less, but sooner received.</p>

<p><em>Three Kings.</em>&mdash;A consultation on important business, the result
of which will be highly satisfactory; if reversed, success
will be doubtful.</p>

<p><em>Two Kings.</em>&mdash;A partnership in business; if reversed, a dissolution
of the same. Sometimes this only denotes friendly
projects.</p>

<p><em>Four Queens.</em>&mdash;Company, society; one or more reversed, denotes
that the entertainment will not go off well.</p>

<p><em>Three Queens.</em>&mdash;Friendly calls; reversed, chattering and scandal
or deceit.</p>

<p><em>Two Queens.</em>&mdash;A meeting between friends; reversed, poverty,
troubles, in which one will involve the other.</p>

<p><em>Four Knaves.</em>&mdash;A noisy party&mdash;mostly young people; reversed, a
drinking bout.</p>

<p><em>Three Knaves.</em>&mdash;False friends; reversed, a quarrel with some low
person.</p>

<p><em>Two Knaves.</em>&mdash;Evil intentions; reversed, danger.</p>

<p><em>Four tens.</em>&mdash;Great success in projected enterprises; reversed, the
success will not be so brilliant, but still it will be sure.</p>

<p><em>Three tens.</em>&mdash;Improper conduct; reversed, failure.</p>

<p><em>Two tens.</em>&mdash;Change of trade or profession; reversed, denotes
that the prospect is only a distant one.</p>

<p><em>Four nines.</em>&mdash;A great surprise; reversed, a public dinner.</p>

<p><em>Three nines.</em>&mdash;Joy, fortune, health; reversed, wealth lost by imprudence.</p>

<p><em>Two nines.</em>&mdash;A little gain; reversed, trifling losses at cards.</p>

<p><em>Four eights.</em>&mdash;A short journey; reversed, the return of a friend
or relative.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p><em>Three eights.</em>&mdash;Thoughts of marriage; reversed, folly, flirtation.</p>

<p><em>Two eights.</em>&mdash;A brief love-dream; reversed, small pleasures and
trifling pains.</p>

<p><em>Four Sevens.</em>&mdash;Intrigues among servants or low people, threats,
snares, and disputes; reversed, that their malice will be impotent
to harm, and that the punishment will fall on themselves.</p>

<p><em>Three sevens.</em>&mdash;Sickness, premature old age; reversed, slight
and brief indisposition.</p>

<p><em>Two sevens.</em>&mdash;Levity; reversed, regret.</p>

<p>Any picture-card between two others of equal value&mdash;as two
tens, two Aces, etc.&mdash;denotes that the person represented by that
card runs the risk of a prison.</p>

<p>It requires no great efforts to commit these significations to
memory, but it must be remembered that they are but what the
alphabet is to the printed book: a little attention and practice,
however, will soon enable the learner to form these mystic letters
into words, and words into phrases; in other language, to
assemble these cards together, and read the events, past and to
come, their pictured faces pretend to reveal.</p>

<p>There are several ways of doing this; but we will give them
all, one after another, so as to afford our readers an ample choice
of methods of prying into futurity.</p>


<h3>DEALING THE CARDS BY THREES.</h3>

<p>Take the pack of thirty-two selected cards (viz., the Ace,
King, Queen, Knave, Ten, Nine, Eight, and Seven of each suit),
having before fixed upon the one you intend to represent yourself,
supposing always you are making the essay on your own
behalf. If not, it must represent the person for whom you are
acting. In doing this, it is necessary to remember that the card
chosen should be according to the complexion of the chooser,
King or Queen of Diamonds for a very fair person, ditto of
Hearts for one rather darker, Clubs for one darker still, and
Spades only for one very dark indeed. The card chosen also
loses its signification, and simply becomes the representative of
a dark or fair man, or woman, as the case may be.</p>

<p>This point having been settled, shuffle the cards, and either
cut them or have them cut for you (according to whether you
are acting for yourself or another person), taking care to use
the <em>left</em> hand. That done, turn them up by <em>threes</em>, and every
time you find in these triplets <em>two of the same suit</em>, such as two
Hearts, two Clubs, etc., withdraw the highest card and place it
on the table before you. If the triplet should chance to be all
of the same suit, the <em>highest</em> card is still to be the only one withdrawn;
but should it consist of three of the <em>same value</em> but
<em>different suits</em>, such as three Kings, etc., they are to be all appropriated.
We will suppose that, after having turned up the cards
three by three, you have been able to withdraw six, leaving
twenty-six, which you shuffle and cut, and again turn up by
threes, acting precisely as you did before, until you have obtained
either <em>thirteen</em>, <em>fifteen</em>, or <em>seventeen</em> cards. Recollect that the
number must always be uneven, and that the card representing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
the person for whom the essay is made must make one of it.
Even if the requisite thirteen, fifteen, or seventeen have been
obtained, and this one has not made its appearance, the operation
must be recommenced. Let us suppose the person whose
fortune is being read to be a lady, represented by the Queen of
Hearts, and that fifteen cards have been obtained and laid out&mdash;in
the form of a half circle&mdash;in the order they were drawn, viz.,
the Seven of Clubs, the Ten of Diamonds, the Seven of Hearts,
the Knave of Clubs, the King of Diamonds, the Nine of Diamonds,
the Ten of Hearts, the Queen of Spades, the Eight of
Hearts, the Knave of Diamonds, the Queen of Hearts, the Nine
of Clubs, the Seven of Spades, the Ace of Clubs, the Eight of
Spades. Having considered your cards, you will find among
them two Queens, two Knaves, two tens, three sevens, two
eights, and two nines; you are, therefore, able to announce:</p>

<p>“The two Queens before me signify the reunion of friends;
the two Knaves, that there is mischief being made between
them. These two tens denote a change of profession, which,
from one of them being between two sevens, I see will not be
effected without some difficulty; the cause of which, according
to these <em>three</em> sevens, will be illness. However, these two nines
promise some small gain, resulting&mdash;so say these two eights&mdash;from
a love affair.”</p>

<p>You now begin to count <em>seven cards, from right to left</em>, beginning
with the Queen of Hearts, who represents the lady you
are acting for. The seventh being the King of Diamonds, you
may say:</p>

<p>“You often think of a fair man in uniform.”</p>

<p>The next seventh card (counting the King of Diamonds as
<em>one</em>) proves to be the Ace of Clubs; you add:</p>

<p>“You will receive from him some very joyful tidings; he, besides,
intends making you a present.”</p>

<p>Count the Ace of Clubs as “one,” and proceeding to the next
seventh card, the Queen of Spades, you resume:</p>

<p>“A widow is endeavoring to injure you on this very account;
and” (the seventh card, counting the Queen as one, being the
Ten of Diamonds) “the annoyance she gives you will oblige
you to either take a journey or change your residence; but”
(this Ten of Diamonds being imprisoned between two sevens)
“your journey or removal will meet with some obstacle.”</p>

<p>On proceeding to count as before, calling the Ten of Diamonds
one, you will find the seventh card proves to be the
Queen of Hearts herself, the person for whom you are acting,
and may therefore safely conclude by saying:</p>

<p>“But this you will overcome of yourself, without needing any
one’s aid or assistance.”</p>

<p>Now take the two cards at either extremity of the half circle,
which are, respectively, the Eight of Spades and the Seven of
Clubs, unite them, and continue:&mdash;</p>

<p>“A sickness, which will lead to your receiving a small sum of
money.”</p>

<p>Repeat the same maneuver, which brings together the Ace of
Clubs and the Ten of Diamonds:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>“Good news, which will make you decide on taking a journey,
destined to prove a very happy one, and which will occasion you
to receive a sum of money.”</p>

<p>The next cards united, being the Seven of Spades and the
Seven of Hearts, you say:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Tranquility and peace of mind, followed by slight anxiety,
quickly succeeded by love and happiness.”</p>

<p>Then come the Nine of Clubs and the Knave of Clubs, foretelling:
“You will certainly receive money through the exertions
of a clever dark young man&mdash;Queen of Hearts and King of Diamonds&mdash;which
comes from a fair man in uniform; this rencounter
announces some great happiness in store for you, and complete
fulfillment of your wishes. Knave of Diamonds and Nine
of Diamonds&mdash;Although this happy result may be delayed for a
time, through some fair young man, not famed for his delicacy&mdash;Eight
of Hearts and Ten of Hearts&mdash;love, joy, and triumph.
The Queen of Spades, who remains alone, is the widow who is
endeavoring to injure you, and who finds herself abandoned by
all her friends!”</p>

<p>Now gather up the cards you have been using, shuffle and cut
them with the left hand, and proceed to make them into three
packs by dealing one to the left, one in the middle, and one to
the right; a fourth is laid aside to form “a surprise.” Then
continue to deal the cards to each of the three packs in turn,
until their number is exhausted, when it will be found that the
left-hand and middle packs contain each five cards, whilst the
one on the right hand consists of only four.</p>

<p>Now ask the person consulting you to select one of the three
packs. We will suppose this to be the middle one, and that the
cards comprising it are, the Knave of Diamonds, the King of
Diamonds, the Seven of Spades, the Queen of Spades, and the
Seven of Clubs. These, by recollecting our previous instructions
regarding the individual and relative signification of the
cards, are easily interpreted, as follows:</p>

<p>“The Knave of Clubs&mdash;a fair young man, possessed of no delicacy
of feeling, who seeks to injure&mdash;the King of Diamonds&mdash;a
fair man in uniform&mdash;Seven of Spades&mdash;and will succeed in causing
him some annoyance&mdash;the Queen of Spades&mdash;at the instigation
of a spiteful woman&mdash;Seven of Clubs&mdash;but, by means of a
small sum of money, matters will be finally easily arranged.”</p>

<p>Next take up the left-hand pack, which is “for the house”&mdash;the
former one having been for the lady herself. Supposing it
to consist of the Queen of Hearts, the Knave of Clubs, the Eight
of Hearts, the Nine of Diamonds, and the Ace of Clubs, they
would read thus:</p>

<p>“Queen of Hearts&mdash;the lady whose fortune is being told is, or
soon will be, in a house&mdash;Knave of Clubs&mdash;where she will meet
with a dark young man, who&mdash;Eight of Hearts&mdash;will entreat her
assistance to forward his interests with a fair girl&mdash;Nine of Diamonds&mdash;he
having met with delays and disappointment&mdash;Ace of Clubs&mdash;but
a letter will arrive announcing the possession of money,
which will remove all difficulties.”</p>

<p>The third pack is “for those who did not expect it,” and will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
be composed of four cards, let us say the Ten of Hearts, Nine of
Clubs, Eight of Spades, and Ten of Diamonds, signifying:</p>

<p>“The Ten of Hearts&mdash;An unexpected piece of good fortune and
great happiness&mdash;Nine of Clubs&mdash;caused by an unlooked-for legacy&mdash;Eight
of Spades&mdash;which joy may perhaps be followed by a
slight sickness&mdash;Ten of Diamonds&mdash;the result of a fatiguing
journey.”</p>

<p>There now remains on the table only the card intended for the
“surprise.” This, however, must be left untouched, the other
cards gathered up, shuffled, cut, and again laid out in three
packs, not forgetting at the first deal to add a card to “the surprise.”
After the different packs have been duly examined and
explained, as before described, they must again be gathered up,
shuffled, etc., indeed, the whole operation repeated, after which
the three cards forming “the surprise” are examined; and supposing
them to be the Seven of Hearts, the Knave of Clubs, and
the Queen of Spades, are to be thus interpreted:</p>

<p>“Seven of Hearts&mdash;pleasant thoughts and friendly intentions&mdash;Knave
of Clubs&mdash;of a dark young man&mdash;relative to a malicious
dark woman, or widow, who will cause him much unhappiness.”</p>


<h3>DEALING THE CARDS BY SEVENS.</h3>

<p>After having shuffled the pack of thirty-two selected cards&mdash;which,
as we before stated, consist of the Ace, King, Queen,
Knave, Ten, Nine, Eight, and Seven of each suit&mdash;either cut them
yourself, or, if acting for another person, let that person cut
them, taking care to use the <em>left</em> hand. Then count seven cards,
beginning with the one lying on the top of the pack. The first
six are useless, so put them aside, and retain only the seventh,
which is to be placed face uppermost on the table before you.
Repeat this three times more, then shuffle and cut the cards you
have thrown on one side, together with those remaining in your
hand, and tell them out in sevens as before, until you have thus
obtained twelve cards. It is, however, indispensable that the
one representing the person whose fortune is being told should
be among the number; therefore, the whole operation must be
recommenced in case of it not having made its appearance.
Your twelve cards being now spread out before you in the order
in which they have come to hand, you may begin to explain
them as described in the manner of dealing the cards in threes&mdash;always
bearing in mind both their individual and relative
signification. Thus, you first count the cards by sevens, beginning
with the one representing the person for whom you are
acting, going from <em>right</em> to <em>left</em>. Then take the two cards at
either extremity of the line or half-circle, and unite them, and
afterwards form the three heaps or packs and “the surprise”
precisely as we have before described. Indeed, the only difference
between the two methods is the manner in which the cards
are obtained.</p>


<h3>DEALING THE CARDS BY FIFTEENS.</h3>

<p>After having well shuffled and cut the cards, or, as we have
before said, had them cut, deal them out in two packs, containing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
sixteen cards in each. Desire the person consulting you to
choose one of them; lay aside the first card, to form “the surprise;”
turn up the other fifteen, and range them in a half-circle
before you, going from left to right, placing them in the
order in which they come to hand, and taking care to remark
whether the one representing the person for whom you are
acting be among them. If not, the cards must be all gathered
up, shuffled, cut, and dealt as before, and this must be repeated
until the missing card makes its appearance in the pack chosen
by the person it represents. Now proceed to explain them&mdash;first,
by interpreting the meaning of any pairs, triplets, or
quartettes among them; then by counting them in sevens, going
from right to left, and beginning with the card representing the
person consulting you; and lastly, by taking the cards at either
extremity of the line and pairing them. This being done, gather
up the fifteen cards, shuffle, cut, and deal them so as to form
three packs of each five cards. From each of these three packs
withdraw the topmost card, and place them on the one laid
aside to form “the surprise,” thus forming four packs of four
cards each.</p>

<p>Desire the person for whom you are acting to choose one of
these packs, “for herself” or “himself,” as the case may be.
Turn it up, and spread out the four cards it contains, from left
to right, explaining their individual and relative signification.
Next proceed in like manner with the pack on your left hand,
which will be “for the house;” then the third one, “for those
who do not expect it;” and lastly, “the surprise.”</p>

<p>In order to render our meaning perfectly clear, we will give
another example. Let us suppose that the pack for the person
consulting you is composed of the Knave of Hearts, the Ace of
Diamonds, the Queen of Clubs, and the Eight of Spades <em>reversed</em>.
By the aid of the list of meanings we have given, it will be easy
to interpret them as follows:</p>

<p>“The Knave of Hearts is a gay young bachelor&mdash;the Ace of
Diamonds&mdash;who has written, or will very soon write, a letter&mdash;the
Queen of Clubs&mdash;to a dark woman&mdash;Eight of Spades reversed&mdash;to
make proposals to her, which will not be accepted.”</p>

<p>On looking back to the list of significations, it will be found
to run thus:</p>

<p><em>Knave of Hearts.</em>&mdash;A gay young bachelor, who thinks only of
pleasure.</p>

<p><em>Ace of Diamonds.</em>&mdash;A letter soon to be received.</p>

<p><em>Queen of Clubs.</em>&mdash;An affectionate woman, but quick-tempered
and touchy.</p>

<p><em>Eight of Spades.</em>&mdash;If reversed, a marriage broken off, or offer
refused.</p>

<p>It will thus be seen that each card forms, as it were, a phrase
from an assemblage of which nothing but a little practice is required
to form complete sentences. Of this we will give a further
example, by interpreting the signification of the three other
packs&mdash;“for the house,” “for those who do not expect it,” and
“the surprise.” The first of these, “for the house,” we will
suppose to consist of the Queen of Hearts, the Knave of Spades<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
<em>reversed</em>, the Ace of Clubs, and the Nine of Diamonds, which
reads thus:</p>

<p>“The Queen of Hearts is a fair woman, mild and amiable in
disposition, who&mdash;Knave of Spades reversed&mdash;will be deceived
by a dark, ill-bred young man&mdash;the Ace of Clubs&mdash;but she will
receive some good news, which will console her&mdash;Nine of Diamonds&mdash;although
it is probable that the news may be delayed.”</p>

<p>The pack “for those who do not expect it,” consisting of the
Queen of Diamonds, the King of Spades, the Ace of Hearts
<em>reversed</em>, and the Seven of Spades, would signify:</p>

<p>“The Queen of Diamonds is a mischief-making woman&mdash;the
King of Spades&mdash;who is in league with a dishonest lawyer&mdash;Ace
of Hearts reversed&mdash;they will hold a consultation together&mdash;Seven
of Spades&mdash;but the harm they will do will soon be
repaired.”</p>

<p>Last comes “the surprise,” formed by, we will suppose, the
Knave of Clubs, the Ten of Diamonds, the Queen of Spades, and
the Nine of Spades, of which the interpretation is:</p>

<p>“The Knave of Clubs is a clever, enterprising young man&mdash;Ten
of Diamonds&mdash;about to undertake a journey&mdash;Queen of
Spades&mdash;for the purpose of visiting a widow&mdash;Nine of Spades&mdash;but
one or both of their lives will be endangered.”</p>


<h3>THE ITALIAN METHOD.</h3>

<p>Take a pack composed of thirty-two selected cards, viz., the
Ace, King, Queen, Knave, Ten, Nine, Eight, and Seven of each
suit. Shuffle them well, and either cut or have them cut for
you, according to whether you are acting for yourself or another
person. Turn up the cards by threes, and when the triplet is
composed of cards of the same suit, lay it aside; when of three
different suits, pass it by without withdrawing any of the three;
but when composed of two of one suit and one of another, withdraw
the highest card of the two. When you have come to the end
of the pack, gather up all the cards except those you have withdrawn;
shuffle, cut, and again turn up by threes. Repeat this
operation until you have obtained fifteen cards, which must
then be spread out before you, from <em>left</em> to <em>right</em>, in the order in
which they come to hand.</p>

<p>Care must, however, be taken that the card representing the
person making the essay is among them; if not, the whole
operation must be recommenced until the desired result is obtained.
We will suppose it to be some dark lady&mdash;represented
by the Queen of Clubs&mdash;who is anxious to make the attempt for
herself, and that the cards are laid out in the following order,
from left to right:&mdash;Ten of Diamonds, Queen of Clubs, Eight of
Hearts, Ace of Diamonds, Ten of Hearts, Seven of Clubs, King
of Spades, Nine of Hearts, Knave of Spades, Ace of Clubs, Seven
of Spades, Ten of Spades, Seven of Diamonds, Ace of Spades,
Knave of Hearts.</p>

<p>On examining them, you will find that there are three Aces
among them, announcing good news; but, as they are at some
distance from each other, that the tidings may be some time before
they arrive.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>The three tens denote that the conduct of the person consulting
the cards has not always been strictly correct. The two
Knaves are enemies, and the three Sevens predict an illness,
caused by them.</p>

<p>You now begin to count <em>five</em> cards, beginning with the
Queen of Clubs, who represents the person consulting you. The
fifth card, being the Seven of Clubs, announces that the lady
will soon receive a small sum of money. The next fifth card
proving to be the Ace of Clubs, signifies that this money will be
accompanied by some very joyful tidings. Next, comes the Ace
of Spades, promising complete success to any projects undertaken
by the person consulting the cards; then the Eight of
Hearts, followed at the proper interval by the King of Spades,
showing that the good news will excite the malice of a dishonest
lawyer; but the Seven of Spades coming next announces that
the annoyance he can cause will be of short duration, and that a
gay fair young man&mdash;the Knave of Hearts&mdash;will soon console
her for what she has suffered. The Ace of Diamonds tells that
she will soon receive a letter from this fair young man&mdash;the Nine
of Hearts&mdash;announcing a great success&mdash;Ten of Spades&mdash;but this
will be followed by some slight chagrin&mdash;Ten of Diamonds&mdash;caused
by a journey&mdash;Ten of Hearts&mdash;but it will soon pass,
although&mdash;Knave of Spades&mdash;a bad, dark young man will
endeavor&mdash;Seven of Diamonds&mdash;to turn her into ridicule. The
Queen of Clubs, being representative of herself, shows that it is
towards <em>her</em> that the dark young man’s malice will be directed.
Now take the cards at either extremity of the line, and pair them
together. The two first being the Knave of Hearts and the Ten
of Diamonds, you may say: “A gay young bachelor is preparing
to take a journey&mdash;Ace of Spades and Queen of Clubs&mdash;which
will bring him to the presence of the lady consulting the cards,
and cause her great joy. Seven of Diamonds and Eight of
Hearts&mdash;Scandal talked about a fair young girl. Ten of Spades
and Ace of Diamonds&mdash;tears shed upon receipt of a letter.
Seven of Spades and Ten of Hearts&mdash;great joy, mingled with
slight sorrow. Seven of Clubs and Ace of Clubs&mdash;A letter promising
money. Knave of Spades and King of Spades&mdash;the winning
of a lawsuit. The Nine of Hearts, being the one card left,
promises complete success.”</p>

<p>Now gather up the cards, shuffle, cut, and deal them out in
five packs&mdash;one for the lady herself, one for the house, one for
“those who do not expect it,” one for “those who do expect it,”
and one for “the surprise,” in the first deal, laying one card
aside for “consolation.” The rest are then equally distributed
among the other five packs, which will four of them contain
three cards, whilst the last only consists of two.</p>

<p>We will suppose the first packet for the lady herself to be
composed of the Ace of Diamonds, the Seven of Clubs, and the
Ten of Hearts. The interpretation would run thus:</p>

<p>“Ace of Diamonds&mdash;a letter will be shortly received&mdash;Seven
of Clubs&mdash;announcing the arrival of a small sum of money&mdash;Ten
of Hearts&mdash;and containing some very joyful tidings.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>The second pack, “for the house,” containing the King of
Spades, the Nine of Hearts, and the Knave of Spades:</p>

<p>“The person consulting the cards will receive a visit&mdash;King of
Spades&mdash;from a lawyer&mdash;Nine of Hearts&mdash;which will greatly delight&mdash;Knave
of Spades&mdash;a dark, ill-disposed young man.”</p>

<p>The third pack, “for those who do not expect it,” composed
of the Ace of Spades, the Knave of Hearts, and the Ace of Clubs,
would read:</p>

<p>“Ace of Spades&mdash;pleasure in store for&mdash;Knave of Hearts&mdash;a
gay young bachelor&mdash;Ace of Clubs&mdash;by means of money; but as
the Knave of Hearts is placed between two Aces, it is evident
that he runs a great risk of being imprisoned; and from the two
cards signifying respectively ‘pleasure’ and ‘money,’ that it
will be for having run into debt.”</p>

<p>The fourth pack, “for those who do expect it,” containing
the Eight of Hearts, the Queen of Clubs, and the Ten of Diamonds:</p>

<p>“The Eight of Hearts&mdash;the love-affairs of a fair young girl will
oblige&mdash;the Queen of Clubs&mdash;the person consulting the cards&mdash;Ten
of Diamonds&mdash;to take a journey.”</p>

<p>The fifth pack, “for the surprise,” consists of the Seven of
Spades and the Ten of Spades, meaning:</p>

<p>“Seven of Spades&mdash;slight trouble&mdash;Ten of Spades&mdash;caused by
some person’s imprisonment&mdash;The Card of Consolation&mdash;Seven
of Diamonds&mdash;which will turn out to have been a mere report.”</p>


<h3>PRESENT, PAST, AND FUTURE.</h3>

<p>The person wishing to try her fortune in this manner (we will
suppose her to be a young, fair person, represented by the Eight
of Hearts), must well shuffle, and cut with the left hand, the
pack of thirty-two cards; after which she must lay aside the
topmost and undermost cards, to form the surprise. There will
now remain thirty cards, which must be dealt out in three parcels&mdash;one
to the left, one in the middle, and one to the right.</p>

<p>The left-hand pack represents the Past; the middle, the Present;
and the one on the right hand, the Future. She must commence
with the “Past,” which we will suppose to contain these
ten cards: The King of Clubs, the Ace of Spades, the Knave of
Diamonds, the Nine of Diamonds, the Ace of Hearts, the Knave
of Hearts, the Queen of Hearts, the King of Spades, the Knave
of Clubs, and the King of Hearts.</p>

<p>She would remark that picture-cards predominating was a
favorable sign; also that the presence of three Kings proved
that powerful persons were interesting themselves in her affairs.
The three Knaves, however, warn her to beware of false friends,
and the Nine of Diamonds predicts some great annoyance,
overcome by some good and amiable person, represented by the
Queen of Hearts. The two Aces also give notice of a plot.
Taking the cards in the order they lay, the explanation would
run thus:</p>

<p>“The King of Clubs&mdash;a frank, open-hearted man&mdash;Ace of
Spades&mdash;fond of gayety and pleasure, is disliked by Knave of
Diamonds&mdash;an unfaithful friend&mdash;Nine of Diamonds&mdash;who seeks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
to injure him. The Ace of Hearts&mdash;a love-letter&mdash;Knave of
Hearts&mdash;from a gay young bachelor to a fair, amiable woman&mdash;Queen
of Hearts&mdash;causes&mdash;King of Spades&mdash;a lawyer to endeavor
to injure a clever&mdash;Knave of Clubs&mdash;enterprising young man,
who is saved from him by&mdash;the King of Hearts&mdash;a good and
powerful man. Nevertheless, as the Knave of Clubs is placed
between two similar cards, he has run great risk of being imprisoned
through the machinations of his enemy.”</p>

<p>The second parcel, “the Present,” containing the Ten of Diamonds,
the Nine of Spades, the Eight of Spades, the Queen of
Diamonds, the Queen of Clubs, the Eight of Hearts, the Seven
of Spades, the Ten of Spades, Queen of Spades, the Eight of
Diamonds, signifies:</p>

<p>“The Ten of Diamonds&mdash;a voyage or journey, at that moment
taking place&mdash;Nine of Spades&mdash;caused by the death or
dangerous illness of some one&mdash;Eight of Spades&mdash;whose state
will occasion great grief&mdash;Queen of Diamonds&mdash;to a fair woman.
The Queen of Clubs&mdash;An affectionate woman seeks to console&mdash;Eight
of Hearts&mdash;a fair young girl, who is the person making
the essay&mdash;Seven of Spades&mdash;who has secret griefs&mdash;Ten of
Spades&mdash;causing her many tears&mdash;Queen of Spades&mdash;these are
occasioned by the conduct of either a dark woman or a widow,
who&mdash;Eight of Diamonds&mdash;is her rival.”</p>

<p>The third packet of cards, “the Future,” we will suppose to
contain the Eight of Clubs, the Ten of Clubs, the Seven of Diamonds,
the Ten of Hearts, the Seven of Clubs, the Nine of
Hearts, the Ace of Diamonds, the Knave of Spades, the Seven
of Hearts, the Nine of Clubs, which would read thus:</p>

<p>“In the first place, the large number of small cards foretells
success in enterprises, although the presence of three sevens
predicts an illness. The Eight of Clubs&mdash;a dark young girl&mdash;Ten
of Clubs&mdash;is about to inherit a large fortune&mdash;Seven of Diamonds&mdash;but
her satirical disposition will destroy&mdash;Ten of Hearts&mdash;all her happiness.
Seven of Clubs&mdash;A little money and&mdash;Nine
of Hearts&mdash;much joy&mdash;Ace of Hearts&mdash;will be announced to the
person making the essay by a letter, and&mdash;Knave of Spades&mdash;a
wild young man&mdash;Seven of Hearts&mdash;will be overjoyed at receiving&mdash;Nine
of Clubs&mdash;some unexpected tidings. The cards of
surprise&mdash;viz., the King of Diamonds and the Ace of Clubs&mdash;predict
that a letter will be received from some military man,
and that it will contain money.”</p>


<h3>THE STAR METHOD OF CONSULTING THE CARDS.</h3>

<p>We will suppose the person making the essay to be a widow,
and consequently represented by the Queen of Spades. This
card is, therefore, to be withdrawn from the pack, and laid,
face uppermost, upon the table. The remaining thirty-one
cards are then to be well shuffled, cut, the topmost card withdrawn
and placed lengthwise, and face uppermost, above the
head of the Queen of Spades. The cards are to be shuffled, cut,
and the topmost card withdrawn, twelve more times, the manner
of their arrangement being this: The Queen of Spades in
the center, the first card lengthwise above her head, the second<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
ditto at her feet, the third on her right side, the fourth on her
left, the fifth placed upright above the first, the sixth ditto
below the second, the seventh at the right of the third, the
eighth at the left of the fourth, the ninth, tenth, eleventh, and
twelfth, at the four corners, and the thirteenth across the center
card&mdash;the Queen of Spades&mdash;thus forming a star.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 526px;">
<img src="images/i_015.jpg" width="526" height="650" alt="Card layout." />
</div>

<p>We will suppose these fourteen cards to be the Queen of
Spades, which represents the person making the essay;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
then&mdash;1. The Ace of Hearts; 2. The King of Clubs; 3. The Ten
of Clubs; 4. Nine of Diamonds; 5. Queen of Clubs; 6. The
Eight of Hearts; 7. The Ten of Spades; 8. The Knave of
Clubs; 9. The Seven of Clubs; 10. The Ten of Hearts; 11. The
Knave of Diamonds; 12. The Eight of Diamonds; 13. The Nine of
Clubs. These being placed at right angles, the person consulting
them takes them up two by two, beginning with those last
laid down.</p>

<p>The first card, 12, the Eight of Diamonds, and the one in the
<em>opposite</em> corner, viz., 11, the Knave of Diamonds, read&mdash;“Overtures
will be made&mdash;Knave of Diamonds&mdash;by a fair young man&mdash;next
two cards, 10 and 9, Ten of Hearts&mdash;which will prove unsuccessful&mdash;Seven
of Clubs&mdash;on account of something connected
with money. Next two cards, 8 and 7, the Knave of Clubs&mdash;a
clever, dark young man&mdash;Ten of Spades&mdash;will be greatly grieved
by, 6&mdash;Eight of Hearts, a fair girl to whom he is attached. Next
two cards, 5 and 4, the Queen of Clubs&mdash;A dark woman&mdash;Nine of
Diamonds&mdash;will be annoyed at not receiving, 3&mdash;Ten of Clubs&mdash;a
sum of money&mdash;next two cards, 2 and 1, the King of Clubs&mdash;which
was to have been sent her by a generous dark man, who is
fond of obliging his friends&mdash;Ace of Hearts&mdash;it will at last arrive,
accompanied by a love-letter&mdash;13th card, placed across the
Queen of Spades, Nine of Clubs&mdash;and be the cause of unexpected
gain to the person consulting the cards.” There is a shorter and
simpler way of doing this, by surrounding the card representing
the person trying his or her fortune, with a less number of
cards.</p>

<p>The cards are shuffled and cut as before described, and the
topmost one withdrawn. We will suppose the center card to be
the Knave of Clubs, representing a dark young man&mdash;the first
topmost one proves to be the Ace of Clubs, and this is placed
above the head of the Knave&mdash;the second, the Eight of Hearts, is
placed at his feet&mdash;the third, the Knave of Diamonds, at his right
side&mdash;the fourth, the Queen of Spades, on his left. These read&mdash;“Ace
of Clubs&mdash;You will soon receive a letter, which will give
you great pleasure&mdash;Eight of Hearts&mdash;from a fair girl. Knave of
Diamonds&mdash;An unfaithful friend&mdash;Queen of Spades&mdash;and a malicious
widow, will seek to injure you on that very account.”</p>


<h3>TO KNOW IF YOU WILL GET YOUR WISH.</h3>

<p>Shuffle the cards well, and cut, or have them cut, with the <em>left</em>
hand. Then deal out thirteen cards. If among these is to be
found one or more Aces lay them aside, shuffle and cut the remaining
ones, and again deal thirteen; withdraw the Aces as
before, and again shuffle, cut, and deal. If, in these three deals,
all four aces make their appearance, you will get your wish.
If all the Aces come at the first deal, the response is in the highest
degree favorable.</p>


<h3>THE ENGLISH METHOD OF CONSULTING THE CARDS.</h3>

<p>Having described the French and Italian methods of consulting
the cards, we will proceed to notice the manner in which the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
art of fortune-telling is generally practiced in England and
Scotland. Hitherto only thirty-two cards have been made use
of, but now the whole pack is employed. The significations
also slightly differ; therefore we shall first give a complete list
of them, and then pass on to describe how the cards are to be
arranged, so as to disclose their mystic meanings.</p>

<p><em>Ace of Clubs.</em>&mdash;Wealth, happiness, and peace of mind.</p>

<p><em>King of Clubs.</em>&mdash;A dark man, upright, faithful, and affectionate
in disposition.</p>

<p><em>Queen of Clubs.</em>&mdash;A dark woman, gentle and pleasing.</p>

<p><em>Knave of Clubs.</em>&mdash;A sincere, but hasty friend&mdash;also a dark
man’s thoughts.</p>

<p><em>Ten of Clubs.</em>&mdash;Unexpected riches, and loss of a dear friend.</p>

<p><em>Nine of Clubs.</em>&mdash;Disobedience to friends’ wishes.</p>

<p><em>Eight of Clubs.</em>&mdash;A covetous man&mdash;also warns against speculations.</p>

<p><em>Seven of Clubs.</em>&mdash;Promises good fortune and happiness; but bids
a person beware of the opposite sex.</p>

<p><em>Six of Clubs.</em>&mdash;Predicts a lucrative business.</p>

<p><em>Five of Clubs.</em>&mdash;A prudent marriage.</p>

<p><em>Four of Clubs.</em>&mdash;Cautions against inconstancy or change of object
for the sake of money.</p>

<p><em>Three of Clubs.</em>&mdash;Shows that a person will be more than once
married.</p>

<p><em>Two of Clubs.</em>&mdash;A disappointment.</p>

<p><em>Ace of Diamonds.</em>&mdash;A letter&mdash;from whom, and about what, is
seen by the neighboring cards.</p>

<p><em>King of Diamonds.</em>&mdash;A fair man, hot-tempered, obstinate, and
revengeful.</p>

<p><em>Queen of Diamonds.</em>&mdash;A fair woman, fond of company, and a
coquette.</p>

<p><em>Knave of Diamonds.</em>&mdash;A near relation, who considers only his
own interests. Also a fair person’s thoughts.</p>

<p><em>Ten of Diamonds.</em>&mdash;Money.</p>

<p><em>Nine of Diamonds.</em>&mdash;Show that a person is fond of roving.</p>

<p>Having given the signification of the various cards, we will
now proceed to describe how they are to be employed. After
having well shuffled, cut them three times, and lay them out in
rows of nine cards each. Select any King or Queen you please
to represent yourself; and wherever you find that card placed,
count nine cards every way, reckoning it as one; and every ninth
card will prove the prophetic one. Before, however, beginning
to count, study well the disposition of the cards, according to
their individual and relative signification. If a married woman
consult the cards, she must make her husband the King of the
same suit of which she is Queen; but if a single woman, she may
make any favorite male friend King of whatever suit she pleases.
As the Knaves of the various suits represent the <em>thoughts</em> of the
persons represented by the picture-cards of a corresponding
color, they should also be counted from.</p>


<h3>TO TELL WHETHER YOU WILL GET YOUR WISH.</h3>

<p>To try whether you will get your wish, shuffle the cards well,
all the time keeping your thoughts fixed upon whatever wish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
you may have formed; cut them once, and remark what card
you cut; shuffle them again, and deal out into three parcels.
Examine each of these in turn, and if you find the card you
turned up next either the one representing yourself&mdash;the Ace of
Hearts or the Nine of Hearts&mdash;you will get your wish. If it be
in the same parcel with any of these, without being next them,
there is a chance of your wish coming to pass at some more distant
period; but if the Nine of Spades makes its appearance,
you may count on being disappointed.</p>

<h2><a name="GOOD_AND_BAD_OMENS" id="GOOD_AND_BAD_OMENS">GOOD AND BAD OMENS.</a></h2>


<p>The word omen is well known to signify a sign, good or bad,
or a prognostic. It may be defined to be that indication of something
future which we get as it were by accident, and without
seeking for. A superstitious regard to omens seems anciently
to have made very considerable additions to the common load of
infelicity. They are in these enlightened days pretty generally
disregarded, and we look back with perfect security and indifference
on those trivial and truly ridiculous accidents which
alternately afford matter of joy and sorrow to our ancestors.
Omens appear to have been so numerous, that we must despair
of ever being able to recover one-half of them, and to evince that
in all ages men have been self-tormentors, the bad omens fill a
catalogue infinitely more extensive than that of the good. An
extensive set of omens has been taken from what first happens
to one, or what animal or person one meets first in the morning,
or at the commencement of an undertaking&mdash;the <em>first-foot</em>,
as it is called. To stumble has been universally held to presage
misfortune. Some semblance of a reason might be found for
this belief, inasmuch as stumbling may be supposed to indicate
that that self-possession and conscious courage, which are in
themselves half a victory over circumstances, are lacking&mdash;the
want of them, therefore, being half a defeat; but in most cases
the interpretation seems altogether arbitrary. The dread of a
hare crossing the path seems to be widely prevalent; while to
see a wolf is a good omen. This feeling is probably a remnant
of warlike times, when the timid hare suggested thoughts of
cowardice and flight; while the bold wolf, sacred to Odin, was
emblematic of victory. The character of the hare for being unlucky
is also connected with the deep-rooted belief that witches
are in the habit of transforming themselves into hares. That to
meet an old woman is unlucky, is another very general belief,
arising, without doubt, from the same causes that led to
their being considered witches. In some places, women in
general are unlucky as first-foot, with the singular exception of
women of bad reputation. This belief prevailed as far back as
the age of Chrysostom. Priests, too, are ominous of evil. If hunters
of old met a priest or friar, they coupled up their hounds and
went home in despair of any further sport that day. This superstition
seems to have died out, except in the case of sailors, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
still consider the clergy a “kittle cargo,” as a Scotch skipper expressed
it, and anticipate a storm or mischance when they have
a black coat on board. This seems as old as the prophet Jonah.
Sneezing, likewise, has long been looked upon as supernatural,
for this reason, that it is sudden, unaccountable, uncontrollable,
and therefore ominous. The person is considered as possessed
for the time, and a form of exorcism is used. A nurse would not
think she had done her duty, if, when her charge sneezes, she
did not say, “Bless the child,” just as the Greeks, more than two
thousand years ago, said, “Zeus protect thee.”</p>

<p>One general remark, however, it is important to make in regard
to omens. An omen is not conceived to be a mere sign of
what is destined to be&mdash;it is conceived as causing, in some mysterious
way, the event it forebodes; and the consequence, it is
thought, may be prevented by some counteracting charm. Thus
the spilling of salt not only forebodes strife, but strife is conceived
as the consequence of the spilling of the salt, and may be
hindered by taking up the spilled salt, and throwing it over the
left shoulder. Perhaps half the superstitious beliefs that yet
survive among civilized and Christian communities group themselves
round the subject of love and marriage&mdash;of such intense
interest to all, yet so mysterious in its origin, and problematic
in its issue. The liking or passion for one individual rather
than any other is so unaccountable, that the God of Love has
been fabled blind; it is of the nature of fascination, magic, spell.
And then, whether happiness or the reverse shall be the result,
seems beyond the reach of ordinary calculation. All is apparently
given over to mystery, chance, fortune; and any circumstances
may, for what we know, influence or indicate what fortune’s
wheel shall bring round. Hence the innumerable ways
of prognosticating which of two or more persons shall be first
married, who or what manner of person shall be the future husband
or wife, the number of children, etc. It is generally at
particular seasons, as at the Eve of St. Agnes, and Halloween,
that the veil of the future may thus be lifted.</p>

<p>The observation of <em>lucky</em> and <em>unlucky</em> days was once an important
matter, and was often the turning-point of great events.
It is now mostly confined to the one subject of marriage. In fixing
the wedding day, May among months and Friday among
days are shunned by many people, both in educated and uneducated
circles; for in this matter, which is the exclusive province
of women, and in which sentiment and fancy are in every way
so much more active than reason, the educated and uneducated
are reduced to a level. We will give a large collection of
omens, with their interpretation, having selected from all the
best works on the subject, and will begin with “Good and Evil
Days”:</p>

<p>1. In an old MS., the writer, after stating that the most learned
mathematicians have decided that the 1st of August, the 4th of
September, and the 11th of March are most injudicious to let
blood, and that philosophers have settled that the 10th of August,
1st of December, and 6th of April are perilous to those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
who surfeit themselves in eating and drinking, continues as follows,
assigning reasons why certain days should be marked as
infelicitous:</p>

<p>“We read of an old Arabian philosopher, a man of divers rare
observations, who did remark three Mundayes in a year to be
most unfortunate either to let blood or begin any notable worke,
viz., the first Munday of April, ye weh day Caine was borne, and
his brother Abell slaine; the 2d is the first Munday of August,
the which day Sodom and Gomorrha were confounded; the 3d
is the last Munday of December, the which day Judas Iscariott
was borne, who betrayed our Saviour Jesus Christ. These three
dayes, together with the Innocents’ Day, by divers of the learned
are reputed to be most unfortunate of all dayes, and ought to be
eschewed by all men for ye great mishaps which often do occur
in them.</p>

<p>“And thus much concerning the opinion of our ancient of
dayes. So in like manner I will repeat unto you certain dayes
yt be observed by some old writers, chiefly the ancient astrologians,
who did allege that there were 28 dayes in the yeare which
were revealed by the Angel Gabriel to the good Joseph, which
ever have been remarked to be very fortunate dayes either to
purge, let bloud, cure wounds, use merchandises, sow seed, plant
trees, build houses, or taking journies, in long or short voyages,
in fighting or giving of battaile, or skirmishing. They also doe
alledge that children who were borne in any of these dayes could
never be poore; and all children who were put to schooles or
colledges in those dayes should become great schollars, and those
who were put to any craft or trade in such dayes should become
perfect artificers and rich, and such as were put to trade in merchandise
should become most wealthy. The dayes be these: the
3d and 13th of January, ye 5th and 28th of Feb., ye 3d, 22d, and
30th of March, the 5th, 22d, and 29th of April, ye 4th and 28th of
May, ye 3d and 8th of June, the 12th, 18th, and 15th of July, ye
12th of August, ye 1st, 7th, 24th, and 28th of September, the 4th
and 15th of October, ye 13th and 19th of Novr., ye 23d and 26th of
December. And thus much concerning ye dayes which are by
ye most curious part of ye learned remarked to be good and
evill.”</p>

<p>2. “Astronomers say that six days of the year are perilous of
death; and therefore they forbid men to let blood of them, or
take any drink; that is to say, January 3, July 1, October 2, the
last of April, August 4, the last day going out of December.
These six days with great diligence ought to be kept, but namely
[?mainly] the latter three, for all the veins are then full. For
then, whether man or beast be knit in them within seven days,
or certainly within fourteen days, he shall die. And if they
take any drinks within fifteen days, they shall die; and if they
eat any goose in three days, within forty days they shall die;
and if any child be born in these three latter days, they shall
die a wicked death. Astronomers and astrologers say that in
the beginning of March, the seventh night, or the fourteenth
day, let the blood of the right arm; and in the beginning of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
April, the 11th day, of the left arm; and in the end of May, 3d
or 5th day, on whether arm thou wilt; and thus, of all the year,
thou shalt orderly be kept from the fever, the falling gout, the
sister gout, and loss of thy sight.”</p>

<p>3. May has its fatalities; the notion that to be married in it is
a bad omen is as old as the age of Ovid. This is not disregarded
in the present day, which will explain the great number of marriages
that take place late in April.</p>

<p>It is remarkable that among the thirty-three sovereigns who
have sat on the English throne since William the Conqueror,
although each of the eleven months has witnessed the accession
of one or more, the month of May has not been so fortunate&mdash;none
having ascended the throne within its limits.</p>

<p>4. Friday is not now generally considered an unlucky day, although
many still hesitate before starting on a journey or getting
married on Friday. The following facts, derived from
history, show how little we have to dread “the fatal day:”</p>

<p>“On Friday, August 21, 1492, Christopher Columbus sailed on
his great voyage of discovery. On Friday, October 12, 1492, he
first discovered land. On Friday, January 4, 1493, he sailed on
his return to Spain, which, if he had not reached in safety, the
happy result would never have been known which led to the
settlement on this vast continent. On Friday, March 15, 1493,
he arrived at Palos in safety. On Friday, November 22, 1493,
he arrived at Hispaniola, in his second voyage to America. On
Friday, June 13, 1494, he, though unknown to himself, discovered
the continent of America. On Friday, March 5, 1496,
Henry VIII. of England gave to John Cabot his commission,
which led to the discovery of North America. This is the first
American state-paper in England. On Friday, September 7,
1565, Melendez founded St. Augustine, the oldest town in the
United States by more than forty years. On Friday, November
10, 1620, the <em>May-Flower</em>, with the Pilgrims, made the harbor of
Province Town, and on the same day they signed that august
compact, the forerunner of our present glorious constitution.
On Friday, December 22, 1620, the Pilgrims made their final
landing at Plymouth Rock. On Friday, February 22, George
Washington, the father of American freedom, was born. On
Friday, June 16, Bunker Hill was seized and fortified. On Friday,
October 7, 1777, the surrender of Saratoga was made, which
had such power and influence in inducing France to declare for
our cause. On Friday, September 22, 1780, the treason of Arnold
was laid bare, which saved us from destruction. On Friday,
October 19, 1781, the surrender at Yorktown, the crowning
glory of the American arms, occurred. On Friday, July 7, 1776,
the motion in Congress was made by John Adams, seconded by
Richard Henry Lee, that the United States colonies were, and of
right ought to be, free and independent.”</p>

<p>5. “Nail gifts” are white specks on the finger-nails; which,
according to their respective situations, are believed to predict
certain events, as indicated in the following couplet, which is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
repeated whilst touching the thumb and each finger in succession:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indentbase">A gift, a friend, a foe,</div>
<div class="indentbase">A lover to come, a journey to go.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Sometimes the augury is expressed in positive terms; as,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indentbase">A gift on the thumb is sure to come:</div>
<div class="indentbase">A gift on the finger is sure to linger.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>This mode of prognostication is of long standing. Melton, in
his “Astrologaster,” a very old work, giving a catalogue of many
superstitious ceremonies, tells us that “to have yellow speckles
in the nailes of one’s hands is a greate signe of death.” In
Reed’s old plays we read:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indentquotebase">“When yellow spots do on your hands appear,</div>
<div class="indentbase">Be certain then you of a corse shall hear.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>6. Sneezing has been held ominous from times of the most remote
antiquity.</p>

<p>The comet of 590 was, according to some authors, the occasion
of a custom, which is extensively diffused among all the
nations of Christendom. In the year of this comet a frightful
plague prevailed, which was alleged to be due to its influence.
While the malady was at its height, a sneezing was frequently
followed by death; whence the saying, <em>God bless you!</em> with
which, since that time, sneezers are saluted. St. Austin tells
us that “the ancients were wont to go to bed again, if they
sneezed while they put on their shoe.” Aristotle says: “Sneezing
from noon to midnight was good, but from night to noon
unlucky.”</p>

<p>7. The custom of throwing an old shoe for good luck over or
after the bride and bridegroom, upon their leaving the church,
or the home of the bride, after the wedding, has, of late years,
been as it were revived. It is, unquestionably, one of those demonstrations
of good wishes which find their way in the commonest
modes of expression. But, it is not confined to weddings;
the propitiation extends to all prospective views of good
fortune.</p>

<p>It is related that an English cattle-dealer desired his wife to
“trull her left shoe arter him,” when he started for Norwich to
buy a lottery-ticket. As he drove off on his errand, he looked
round to see if she practiced the charm, and consequently he
received the shoe in his face, with such force as to black his
eyes. He went, and bought his ticket, which turned up a prize
of £600.</p>

<p><a id="Ref_8"></a>8. The horse-shoe has been, from time immemorial, considered
a protection from witchcraft and other ills; and has been
nailed at the entrance of dwellings, to prevent the entrance of
witches.</p>

<p>Butler, in “Hudibras,” makes his conjurer chase away evil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
spirits by the horse-shoe; and Gay, in one of his Fables, makes
a supposed witch complain:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indentbase">“The horse-shoe’s nailed, each threshold’s guard.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Nelson the great English admiral, was of a credulous turn,
had great faith in the luck of a horse-shoe, and one was nailed
to the mast of the ship <em>Victory</em>. “Lucky Dr. James” attributed
the success of his fever-powder to his finding a horse-shoe.
When a poor apothecary, he was introduced to Newbery, of St.
Paul’s church-yard, to vend the medicine for him. One Sunday
morning, as James was on his way to Newbery’s country-house
at Vauxhall, in passing over Westminster Bridge, seeing a horse-shoe
lying in the road, and considering it to be a sign of good
luck, he put the shoe into his pocket. As Newbery was a shrewd
man, he became James’s agent for the sale of his fever-powder;
whilst the doctor ascribed all his success to the horse-shoe,
which he subsequently adopted as the crest upon his carriage.
(See <a href="#Ref_62">62</a>.)</p>

<p>9. Cauls are little membranes found on some children, encompassing
the head when born. This is thought a good omen
to the child itself, and many believe that whoever obtains it by
purchase will be fortunate and escape dangers. The caul is
esteemed an infallible preservative against drowning, and is
much sought after by sailors.</p>

<p>10. Salt falling toward a person was considered formerly as a
very unlucky omen. Something had either already happened to
one of the family, or was shortly to befall the persons spilling it.
It denotes also the quarreling of friends. It is thought, however,
that the evil consequences arising from spilling salt may be
averted by throwing a little of the salt over the left shoulder, or
immediately eating a <em>pinch</em> of it. In the “British Apollo,” published
in London, 1708, we find the following in relation to the
superstition:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indentquotebase">“We’ll tell you the reason</div>
<div class="indentone">Why spilling of salt</div>
<div class="indentone">Is esteemed such a fault;</div>
<div class="indentbase">Because it doth everything season.</div>
<div class="indentone">The antiques did opine,</div>
<div class="indentone">’Twas of friendship a sign,</div>
<div class="indentbase">So served it to guests in decorum;</div>
<div class="indentone">And thought love decayed,</div>
<div class="indentone">When the negligent maid</div>
<div class="indentbase">Let the saltcellar tumble before them.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>11. The casual putting the left shoe on the right foot, or the
right on the left, was thought in old times to be the forerunner of
some unlucky accident. Scott, in his “Discovery of Witchcraft,”
tells us: “He that receiveth a mischance will consider whether
he put not on his shirt wrong side outwards, or his left shoe on
his right foot.” Thus Butler in his “Hudibras”:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indentquotebase">“Augustus, having b’ oversight,</div>
<div class="indentbase">Put on his left shoe ’fore his right,</div>
<div class="indentbase">Had like to have been slain that day.</div>
<div class="indentbase">By soldiers mutiny’ng for pay.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>Similar to this is putting on one stocking with the wrong side
outward, without design; though changing it alters the luck;
and if you accidentally put on any garment wrong side out, and
make a wish before changing it, the wish will come true.</p>

<p><a id="Ref_12"></a>12. To arise on the <em>right</em> side is accounted lucky. In the old
play of the “Dumb Knight,” published 1633, Act iv., Scene 1,
Alphonso says:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indentquotebase">“Sure I said my prayers, <em>rose on my right side</em>,</div>
<div class="indentbase">Washed my hands and eyes, put on my girdle last;</div>
<div class="indentbase">Sure I met no splay-footed baker,</div>
<div class="indentbase">No hare did cross me, nor no bearded witch,</div>
<div class="indentbase">Nor other ominous sign.” (See <a href="#Ref_27">27</a>.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>13. When the nose itches, it is a sign that you will have company
visit you the same day. In Melton’s “Astrologaster,” No.
27, it is observed “that when a <em>man’s nose itcheth</em> it is a sign he
shall drink wine;” and in No. 28, that, “if <em>your lips itch</em>, it is a
sign you shall kisse somebody.”</p>

<p><a id="Ref_14"></a>14. The nose falling a-bleeding appears, by the following passage
from an old play, to have been an omen of bad luck:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indentquotebase">“How superstitiously we mind our evils!</div>
<div class="indentbase">The throwing down of salt, or crossing of a hare,</div>
<div class="indentbase"><em>Bleeding at nose</em>, the stumbling of a horse,</div>
<div class="indentbase">Or singing of a cricket, are of power</div>
<div class="indentbase">To daunt whole man in us.” (See <a href="#Ref_27">27</a> and <a href="#Ref_40">40</a>.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p><a id="Ref_15"></a>15. Washing the hands, says Grose, in the same basin, or with
the same water, that another person has washed in, is extremely
unlucky, as the parties will infallibly quarrel.</p>

<p>16. Candle omens are very numerous. Melton, in his “Astrologaster,”
says: “If a candle burne blue, it is a signe that there is
a spirit in the house, or not farre from it.” A collection of tallow,
says Grose, rising up against the wick of a candle, is styled
a winding sheet, and deemed an omen of death in the family.</p>

<p>A spark at the candle, says the same author, denotes that the
party opposite to it will shortly receive a letter. A kind of fungus
in the candle, observes the same writer, predicts the visit
of a stranger from the part of the country nearest the object.
Others say it implies the arrival of a parcel. (See <a href="#Ref_59">59</a>.)</p>

<p>Dr. Goldsmith, in his “Vicar of Wakefield,” speaking of the
waking dreams of his hero’s daughters, says: “The girls had
their omens too; they saw rings in the candles.”</p>

<p>17. In the “Secret Memoirs of the late Mr. Duncan Campbell,”
published in London, 1732, the author says: “I have seen
people who, after writing a <em>letter</em>, have prognosticated to themselves
the ill success of it, if by any accident it happened to fall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
to the ground; others have seemed as impatient and exclaiming
against their want of thought, if through haste or forgetfulness
they have chanced to hold it before the fire to dry; but the mistake
of a word in it is a sure omen that whatever requests it carries
shall be refused.”</p>

<p>18. If two spoons are accidentally placed in a cup or saucer
at table, it signifies a wedding will soon take place in the family.</p>

<p>19. To have a picture drop out of its frame, or to have a
precious stone or any ornament drop from its setting while
wearing or using it, is a bad omen.</p>

<p>Stow, in his <cite>Chronicle</cite>, relates that the silver cross which was
wont to be carried before Wolsey fell out of its socket, and was
like to have knocked out the brains of one of his servants. A
very little while after came in a messenger, and arrested the
cardinal before he could get out of the house.</p>

<p>20. The removal of a long-worn ring from the finger was
thought unlucky in Elizabeth’s time; for the Queen, in her last
illness (says Baker), commanded the ring to be filed off her
finger, wherewith she was so solemnly at first inaugurated into
the kingdom, and since that time had never taken it off; it being
grown into the flesh of the finger in such a manner that it could
not be drawn off without filing.</p>

<p>21. There is an omen called “Setting the New Year in,”&mdash;that
if the kindly office is performed by some one with <em>dark</em> hair,
good fortune will smile on the household; while it augurs ill if
a <em>light-haired</em> person is the first to enter the house in the New
Year.</p>

<p>22. It is a very ancient superstition that all sudden pains of the
body, and other sensations which could not naturally be accounted
for, were presages of somewhat that was shortly to
happen. Shakspeare alludes to this in the following lines from
Macbeth:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indentquotebase">“By the pricking of my thumbs,</div>
<div class="indentbase">Something wicked this way comes.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>23. In olden times, the cat sneezing appears to have been considered
as a lucky omen to a bride who was to be married the
next day.</p>

<p><a id="Ref_24"></a>24. Small spiders, termed <em>money spinners</em>, are held by many to
prognosticate good luck, if they are not destroyed or injured,
or removed from the person on whom they are first observed.
In the “Secret Memoirs” of Mr. Duncan Campbell, in the chapter
of omens, we read that “others have thought themselves
secure of receiving money, if by chance a little spider fell upon
their clothes.” (See <a href="#Ref_33">33</a>.)</p>

<p><a id="Ref_25"></a>25. It is extremely unlucky, says Grose, to kill a lady-bug, a
swallow, robin redbreast, or wren. There is a particular distich,
he adds, in favor of the robin and wren:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indentquotebase">“A robin and a wren</div>
<div class="indentbase">Are God Almighty’s cock and hen.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Persons killing any of the above-named birds or insects, or
destroying their nests, will infallibly, within the course of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
year, break a bone, or meet with some other dreadful misfortune.
On the contrary, it is deemed lucky to have swallows build
their nests in the eaves of a house, or in the chimneys.</p>

<p>In an old pastoral published in London, 1770, the following
occurs:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indentquotebase">“I found a <em>robin’s nest</em> within our shed,</div>
<div class="indentbase">And in the barn a <em>wren</em> had young ones bred.</div>
<div class="indentbase">I never take away their nest, nor try</div>
<div class="indentbase">To catch the old ones, lest a friend should die.</div>
<div class="indentbase">Dick took a wren’s nest from his cottage side,</div>
<div class="indentbase">And ere a twelvemonth past his mother dy’d.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>26. It is deemed very unlucky to hear a screech-owl at night.
“If an owl,” says Bourne, “which is reckoned a most abominable
and unlucky bird, send forth its hoarse and dismal voice, it
is the omen of the approach of some terrible thing&mdash;that some
dire calamity and some great misfortune is at hand.” (See <a href="#Ref_56">56</a>.)</p>

<p>This omen occurs in Chaucer:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indentquotebase">“The jelous swan, ayenst hys deth that singeth,</div>
<div class="indentbase">The <em>oule</em> eke, that of deth the bode bringeth.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The following lines occur in the old pastoral before quoted in
<a href="#Ref_25">25</a>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indentquotebase">“Within my cot, where quiet gave me rest,</div>
<div class="indentbase">Let the dread screech-owl build her hated nest,</div>
<div class="indentbase">And from my window o’er the country send</div>
<div class="indentbase">Her midnight screams to bode my latter end.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p><a id="Ref_27"></a>27. It has always been considered a very bad omen to have a
hare (see <a href="#Ref_14">14</a>), sow, or weasel cross your path when going on a
journey or to business. Melton, in his “Astrologaster,” says,
that “it is a very unfortunate thing for a man to meete early in
the morning an ill-favored man or woman, a rough-footed hen,
a shag-haired dog, or a black cat.” Shaw, in his “History of
Money,” tells us that the ancient Scots much regarded omens in
their expeditions; an armed man or a wolf meeting them was a
good omen; if a woman barefoot crossed the road before them,
they seized her and fetched blood from her forehead; if a deer,
fox, hare, or any kind of game appeared, and they did not kill it,
it was an unlucky omen. We gather from a remarkable book,
entitled “The School-master,” published in London, 1583, that
in the ages of chivalry it was thought unlucky to meet with a
priest, if a man was going forth to war or a tournament.</p>

<p>The following superstitions among the Malabrians are related
in Phillips’s account of them, published in 1717: “It is interpreted
as a very bad sign if a blind man, a Bramin, or a washerwoman
meets one on the way; as also when one meets a man
with an empty panel, or when one sees an oil mill, or if a man
meets us with his head uncovered, or when one hears a weeping
voice, or sees a cat or fox crossing the way, or a dog running on
his right hand, or when a poor man or a widow meets us on our
way, or when we are called back.” (See <a href="#Ref_37">37</a>.)</p>

<p>Gaule, in his “Mag-astromancers Posed and Puzzel’d,” holds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
it as a vain observation “to bode good or bad luck from the rising
up on the right or left side (see <a href="#Ref_12">12</a>); from lifting the left leg
over the threshold, at first going out of doors; from the meeting
of a beggar or a priest the first in a morning; the meeting of a
virgin or a harlot first; the running in of a child between two
friends; the justling one another at unawares; one treading
upon another’s toes; to meet one fasting that is lame or defective
in any member; to wash in the same water with another.”
(See <a href="#Ref_15">15</a>.)</p>

<p>28. To walk under a ladder portends disappointment.</p>

<p>29. To comb your hair after dark is also a sign of disappointment.</p>

<p>30. If a young lady loses her garter, it presages that she has
an inconstant lover; therefore, O lady, when thou hast this ill
augury, look about thee, and become the happy possessor of two
strings to thy bow, or, what is the same thing, two beaus to thy
string.</p>

<p>N. B.&mdash;Rich or very good-looking young ladies may treat the
above with disdain.</p>

<p>31. If you sing before breakfast, it denotes that you will cry
before supper.</p>

<p>32. To drop a dish-cloth, duster, or any cleaning cloth, signifies
the arrival of one or more visitors.</p>

<p><a id="Ref_33"></a>33. If a spider, in weaving his web in some high place, comes
downward before your face, you may look for money from some
unexpected source. (See <a href="#Ref_24">24</a>.)</p>

<p>34. If you make a rhyme involuntarily, before speaking again
make a wish, and it will be fulfilled.</p>

<p>35. When you sleep in a strange bed, remember your dream
and tell it before breakfast. Observing these precautions, the
dream will probably come to pass.</p>

<p>36. To break a needle while making a garment, is a sign that
the owner will live to wear it out.</p>

<p><a id="Ref_37"></a>37. If you return after starting on a journey, it signifies bad
luck. (See <a href="#Ref_27">27</a>.)</p>

<p>38. To remove a cat, with a family when changing residence,
will bring bad luck.</p>

<p>39. If a vacant rocking-chair is rocked violently, the next person
who sits in it will be in danger of being ill within the year.</p>

<p><a id="Ref_40"></a>40. It is a lucky sign to have crickets in the house. Grose
says it is held extremely unlucky to kill a cricket, perhaps from
the idea of its being a breach of hospitality, this insect taking
refuge in houses. The voice of a cricket, says the “Spectator,”
has struck more terror than the roaring of a lion.</p>

<p>The following line occurs in Dryden’s and Lee’s “Œdipus:”</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indentquotebase">“Owls, ravens, <em>crickets</em>, seem the watch of death.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Melton says that “it is a signe of death to some in that house
where crickets have been many yeares, if on a sudden they forsake
the chimney.” (See <a href="#Ref_14">14</a>.)</p>

<p>41. It is said that a married person will not get rich until the
wedding clothes are worn out. It is also said to be a sign that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
one will fail to get rich who tries to see to work between daylight
and dark.</p>

<p>42. It is a bad omen to postpone a marriage after the time
positively appointed.</p>

<p>43. If your right ear burns or itches, it is a sign that some absent
person is speaking well of you; your left ear burning, signifies
that you are being spoken ill of.</p>

<p>44. The superstition has become almost universal, that the
ticking of a little insect called the “death-watch,” presages the
death of some one in the house.</p>

<p>“How many people have I seen in the most terrible palpitations,
for months together, expecting every hour the approach
of some calamity, only by a little worm, which breeds in an old
wainscot, and, endeavoring to eat its way out, makes a noise
like the movement of a watch!”&mdash;<cite>Secret Memoirs of the late Mr.
Duncan Campbell</cite>, 1732.</p>

<p>The following witty account of this superstition, by Dean
Swift, furnishes us with a charm to avert the omen:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indenttwo">&mdash;&mdash;“A wood-worm</div>
<div class="indentbase">That lies in old wood, like a hare in her form,</div>
<div class="indentbase">With teeth or with claws it will bite, or will scratch,</div>
<div class="indentbase">And chambermaids christen this worm a death-watch,</div>
<div class="indentbase">Because, like a watch it always cries click;</div>
<div class="indentbase">Then woe be to those in the house who are sick;</div>
<div class="indentbase">For as sure as a gun they will give up the ghost,</div>
<div class="indentbase">If the maggot cries click, when it scratches the post.</div>
<div class="indentbase">But a kettle of boiling hot water injected</div>
<div class="indentbase">Infallibly cures the timber affected;</div>
<div class="indentbase">The omen is broken, the danger is over,</div>
<div class="indentbase">The maggot will die, and the sick will recover.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>45. If a knife, scissors, or any sharp-pointed instrument is
dropped, and stands, sticking in the floor, company may be expected.</p>

<p>46. The right hand itching is a sign that the person will shake
hands with a stranger; the left hand itching is a sign that money
will be received soon.</p>

<p>47. If you sing during any meal, it is a sign you will soon be
disappointed.</p>

<p>48. To cross a funeral procession is an ill omen.</p>

<p>49. To find a pearl in an oyster betokens good fortune.</p>

<p>50. To break a looking-glass foretells death. Grose tells us
that “breaking a looking-glass betokens a mortality in the
family, commonly the master.” Bonaparte’s (Napoleon I.)
superstition upon this point is often recorded. “During one of
his campaigns in Italy,” says M. de Constant, “he broke the
glass over Josephine’s portrait. He never rested till the return
of the courier he forthwith dispatched to assure himself of her
safety, so strong was the impression of her death upon his
mind.”</p>

<p>51. To find a trefoil, or four-leaved clover, implies good luck;
a five-leaved clover, bad luck. Melton, in his “Astrologaster,”
says that “if a man walking in the fields, finde any foure-leaved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
grasse, he shall, in a small while after, finde some good
thing.”</p>

<p>52. If four persons cross hands while in the act of shaking
hands, it indicates that two of the party will soon be married.</p>

<p>53. If three unmarried persons having the same Christian
name meet at table, it is a sign that one of the three will be
married within a year.</p>

<p>54. To be startled by a snake is a sign of sickness.</p>

<p><a id="Ref_55"></a>55. When thirteen persons sit down together at table, it is a
sign that one of the party will die within a year. Fosbroke, in
his <cite>Encyclopædia of Antiquities</cite>, states that “thirteen in company
was considered an unlucky number by the ancient
Romans;” but he does not give any classical authority for this
statement.</p>

<p>There is at Dantzic a clock, which at 12 admits, through a
door, Christ and the eleven, shutting out Judas, who is admitted
at 1. But is not the belief older than the clock? The iniquity of
Judas may have led him to be considered the thirteenth at the
Lord’s Supper; and his self-destruction may have given to the
number thirteen its fatal association.</p>

<p>It has, however, been explained away by M. Quetelet, in his
work on <cite>Probabilities</cite> as follows: “If the probability be required,
that out of thirteen persons, of different ages, one of them, at
least, shall die within a year, it will be found that the chances
are about one to one that one death, at least, will occur. This
calculation, by means of a false interpretation, has given rise to
the prejudice, no less ridiculous, that the danger will be avoided
by inviting a greater number of guests, which can only have the
effect of augmenting the probability of the event so much apprehended.”</p>

<p>This belief obtains in Italy and Russia, as well as in England.
Moore, in his <cite>Diary</cite>, vol. ii., p. 206, mentions there being thirteen
at dinner, one day, at Madame Catalani’s, when a French countess,
who lived with her up-stairs, was sent for to remedy the
grievance.</p>

<p>“Lord L(ansdowne) said he had dined once abroad with
Count Orloff, and perceived he did not sit down at dinner, but
kept walking from chair to chair; he found afterward it was
because the Narishken were at table, who, he knew, would rise
instantly if they perceived the number thirteen, which Orloff
would have made by sitting down himself.” (See <a href="#Ref_63">63</a>.)</p>

<p><a id="Ref_56"></a>56. If a dog bays under your window at night, it portends sickness
or death.</p>

<p>Shakspeare ranks this among omens. In the play of Henry
VI., he says:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indentquotebase">“The owl shrieked at thy birth; an evil sign!</div>
<div class="indentbase">The night-crow cry’d, aboding luckless time;</div>
<div class="indentbase"><em>Dogs howl’d</em>, and hideous tempests shook down trees.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>57. The howling of dogs, says Grose, is a certain sign that some
one of the family will very shortly die.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>The following passage is in the “Merry Devil” of Edmonton,
1631:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indentthree">“I hear the watchful dogs</div>
<div class="indentbase">With hollow howling tell of thy approach.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>58. If you break your shoe-string, look out for your sweetheart,
for she will bestow her love upon a stranger.</p>

<p><a id="Ref_59"></a>59. A flake of soot hanging at the bars of the grate, denotes
the visit of a stranger, like the fungus of a candle, from the
part of the country nearest the object.</p>

<p>Dr. Goldsmith, in his “Vicar of Wakefield,” among the omens
of his hero’s daughters, tells us “purses bounded from the fire.”
In some parts of England, the cinders that bound from the fire
are carefully examined by old women and children, and according
to their respective forms are called either <em>coffins</em> or <em>purses</em>;
and consequently thought to be presages of death or wealth.</p>

<p>A coal, says Grose, in the shape of a coffin, flying out of the
fire towards any particular person, betokens their death not far
off.</p>

<p>Cowper alludes to this superstition in the following lines in
his “Winter Evening:”</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indentquotebase">“Me oft has fancy, ludicrous and wild,</div>
<div class="indentbase">Sooth’d with a waking dream of <em>houses</em>, <em>towers</em>,</div>
<div class="indentbase"><em>Trees</em>, <em>churches</em>, and strange visages express’d</div>
<div class="indentbase"><em>In the red cinders</em>, while with poring eye</div>
<div class="indentbase">I gazed, myself creating what I saw.</div>
<div class="indentbase">Nor less amused have I quiescent watch’d</div>
<div class="indentbase"><em>The sooty films that play upon the bars,</em></div>
<div class="indentbase"><em>Pendulous, and foreboding</em> in the view</div>
<div class="indentbase">Of superstition, <em>prophesying still</em>,</div>
<div class="indentbase">Though still deceived, some stranger’s near approach.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>60. To drop a slice of bread, with the buttered side down, is a
sign that a visitor will come hungry.</p>

<p>61. To eat up all the food which is on the table at tea-time, is
a sign that the morrow will be a fair day.</p>

<p><a id="Ref_62"></a>62. In olden times it was not considered a good omen to find
money. Melton says that “it is a sign of ill-luck to find money.”
We have seen superstitious people, at the present day, keep for
luck any piece of money they found, but Greene, in his “Art
of Cony-Catching,” a very old work, tells us: “’Tis ill luck to
keep found money.” Therefore it must be spent. Mason, in his
“Anatomie of Sorcerie,” 1612, enumerating our superstitions,
mentions as one omen of good luck, “if drink be spilled upon
a man: or if he find old iron.” Hence it is accounted a lucky
omen to find a <em>horseshoe</em>. (See <a href="#Ref_8">8</a>.)</p>

<p><a id="Ref_63"></a>63. The ancients thought there was luck in odd numbers. In
setting a hen, says Grose, the good women hold it as an indispensible
rule to put an odd number of eggs. All sorts of remedies
are ordered to be taken, three, seven, or nine times. Salutes
of cannon consist of an odd number. Notwithstanding these
opinions in favor of odd numbers, the number thirteen is considered
very ominous. (See <a href="#Ref_55">55</a>.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>


<h3>CONCLUDING REMARKS.</h3>

<p>The belief in omens has existed in all ages and countries, and
traces of it linger even yet in the most civilized communities,
in the dread, for instance, that many entertain of sitting down
to table in a party of thirteen. Not a little of the philosophy
of omens is contained in the Scottish proverb: “Them who follow
freits, freits follow;” meaning that a fantastic belief in impending
evil paralyzes the endeavor that might prevent it.</p>

<p>There are few omens, perhaps none, which are not universal
in their authority, though every land in turn fancies them (like
its proverbs) of local prescription and origin. The death-watch
extends from America to Cashmere, and across India diagonally
to the remotest nook of Bengal, over three thousand miles distance
from the entrance of the Indian Punjaub. A hare crossing
a man’s path, on starting in the morning, has been held in
all countries alike to prognosticate evil in the course of that day.</p>

<h2><a name="WEATHER_OMENS" id="WEATHER_OMENS">WEATHER OMENS.</a></h2>


<h3>FOR FINE AND DRY WEATHER OF LONG CONTINUANCE.</h3>

<p>1. If the wind be north, north-west, or east, then veer to the
north-east, remain there two or three days without rain, and
then veer to the south without rain; and if thence it change
quickly, though perhaps with a little rain, to the north-east, and
remain there&mdash;such fine weather will last occasionally for two
months.</p>

<p>2. If there be dry weather with a weak south wind for five,
six, or seven days, it having previously blown strongly from the
same quarter.</p>

<p>3. If spiders in spinning their webs, make the terminating
filaments long, we may, in proportion to their length, conclude
that the weather will be serene, and continue so for ten or
twelve days.</p>

<p>4. If there are no falling stars to be seen on a bright summer’s
evening, you may look for fine weather.</p>

<p>5. If there be a change from continued stormy or wet to clear
and dry weather, at the time of new or full moon, or a short
time before or after, and so remain until the second day of the new
or full moon, it is likely to remain fine till the following quarter;
and if it change not then, or only for a very short time, it usually
lasts until the following new or full moon; and if it does not
change then, or only for a very short time, it is likely to continue
fine and dry for four or five weeks.</p>

<p>6. If there be a change of weather at the time of the quarters,
&amp;c. (under the same circumstances as in No. 5), it will probably
last for some time.</p>

<p>7. Spiders generally alter their webs once in 24 hours; if they
do this between six and seven in the evening, there will be a
fine night; if they alter their web in the morning, a fine day; if
they work during rain, expect fine weather; and the more active
and busy the spider is, the finer will be the weather.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>8. If near the full moon there be a general mist before sunrise;
or</p>

<p>9. If there be a sheep-sky, or white clouds driving to the
north-west, it will be fine for some days.</p>


<h3>FOR FOUL AND WET WEATHER.</h3>

<p>10. If the sun rise pale, or pale-red, or even dark-blue, there
will be <em>rain during the day</em>.</p>

<p>11. If the clouds at sunrise be red, there will be <em>rain the following
day</em>.</p>

<p>12. If at sunrise many dark clouds are seen in the west, and
remain, there will be <em>rain on that day</em>.</p>

<p>13. If the sun rise covered with a dark-spotted cloud; <em>rain
the same day</em>.</p>

<p>14. If in the winter there be a red sky at sunrise; <em>steady rain
same day</em>; in summer, <em>showers and wind</em>.</p>

<p>15. If the sun set in dark heavy clouds; <em>rain next day</em>.</p>

<p>16. But if it rain directly; <em>wind the following day</em>.</p>

<p>17. If the sun set pale or purple; <em>rain or wind the following
day</em>.</p>

<p>18. If the sun set, and there be a very red sky in the east,
<em>wind</em>; in the south-east, <em>rain</em>.</p>

<p>19. If long strips of clouds drive at a slow rate high in the air,
and gradually become larger, the sky having been previously
clear, there will be wet.</p>

<p>20. If there be many falling stars on a clear evening, in the
summer, there will be <em>thunder</em>.</p>

<p>21. If there be a change of the wind from the north-west or
west, to the south-west or south, or else from the north-east or
east, to the south-east or south; <em>wet</em>.</p>

<p>22. If the sun burn more than usual, or there be a halo round
the sun during fine weather; <em>wet</em>.</p>

<p>23. If it rain and the sun shine; <em>showers</em>.</p>

<p>24. If the full moon rise pale; <em>wet</em>.</p>

<p>25. If the full moon rise red; <em>wind</em>.</p>

<p>26. If the stars appear larger, and closer, and flicker; <em>rain or
wind</em>.</p>

<p>27. If small white clouds, with rough edges, be seen to gather
together; <em>there will be wind</em>.</p>

<p>28. Before thunder it often begins to blow.</p>

<p>29. If there be a fleecy sky, unless driving north-west; <em>wet</em>.</p>

<p>30. If clouds at different heights float in different directions.</p>

<p>Let each one present deposit any sum agreed on, but of
course some trifle; put a complete pack of fifty-two cards, well
shuffled, in a bag or reticule. Let the party stand in a circle,
and the bag being handed around, each draw three cards.
Pairs of any are favorable omens of some good fortune about to
occur to the party, and gets back from the pool the sum that
each agreed to pay. The king of hearts is here made the god of
love, and claims double, and gives a faithful swain to the fair
one who has the good fortune to draw him; if Venus, the queen
of hearts, is with him, it is the conquering prize, and clears the
pool; fives and nines are reckoned crosses and misfortunes, and
pay a forfeit of the sum agreed on to the pool, besides the usual
stipend at each new game; three nines at one draw shows the
lady will be an old maid; <a id="Ref_36"></a>three fives, a bad husband.</p>

<p>Almost all persons (being of the male sex) that are born on
the days included in the foregoing table, will, in a greater or
less degree suffer, not only by pecuniary embarrassment and
losses of property, but will also experience great distress and
anxiety of mind, much dissatisfaction, dissension, and unhappiness
in their family affairs, much dissatisfaction to each
other among the married ones (indeed few of them can ever
be happy in the married state), trouble about their children,
daughters forming unfortunate attachments, and a variety of
untoward events of other descriptions which our limits do not
allow us to particularize. The influence of these days are of a
quality and tendency calculated to excite in the minds of persons
born on them, an extraordinary itch for speculation, to
make changes in their affairs, commence new undertakings of
various kinds, but all of them will tend nearly to one point,
loss of property and pecuniary embarrassments. Such persons
who embark their capital on credit in new concerns or engagements,
will be likely to receive checks or interruptions to the
progress of their schemes or undertakings. Those who enter
into engagements intended to be permanent, whether purchases,
leases, partnerships, or in short any other speculation of a description
which cannot readily be transferred or got rid of will
dearly <em>repent their bargains</em>.</p>

<p>They will find their affairs from time to time much interrupted
and agitated, and experience many disappointments in
money matters, trouble through bills, and have need of all their
activity and address to prop their declining credit; indeed almost
all engagements and affairs that are entered upon by persons
born on any of these days will receive some sort of check
or obstruction. The greater number of those persons born on
these days will be subject to weakness or sprains in the knees
and ankles, also diseases and hurts in the legs.</p>

<p>We particularly advise all females born on these days to be
<a id="Ref_39"></a>extremely cautious of placing their affections too hastily, as they
will be subject to <em>disappointments</em> and <em>vexations</em> in that respect;
it will be better for them (in those matters) to be guided by the
advice of their friends, rather than by their own feelings, they will
be less fortunate in placing their affections, than in any other
action of their lives, as many of these marriages will terminate
in separations, divorces, &amp;c. Their courtships will end in elopements,
seductions, and other ways not necessary of explanation.
Our readers must be well aware that affairs of importance
begun at inauspicious times, by those who have been born at
those periods when the stars shed their malign influence, can
seldom, if ever, lead to much good; it is, therefore, that we endeavor
to lay before them a correct statement drawn from accurate
astrological information, in order that by strict attention
and care, they may avoid falling into those perplexing labyrinths
from which nothing but that care and attention can save them.
The list of days we have above given, will be productive of
hasty and clandestine marriages&mdash;marriages under untoward
circumstances, perplexing attachments, and as a natural consequence,
the displeasure of friends, together with family broils,
dissensions, and divisions. We now present our readers with a</p>

<p>Although the greater number, or indeed nearly all the ladies
that are born on the days stated in the preceding list, will be
likely to meet with a <em>prospect</em> of marriage, or become engaged in
some love affair of more than ordinary importance, yet it must
not be expected that the <em>result</em> will be the same with all of them;
with some they will <em>terminate</em> in <em>marriage</em>&mdash;with others in disappointment&mdash;and
some of them will be in danger of forming
<em>attachments</em> that may prove of a somewhat <em>troublesome</em> description.
We shall, therefore, in order to enable our readers to distinguish
them, give a comprehensive and useful list, showing
which of them will be most likely to marry.</p>

<p>Those born within the limits of the succeeding List of Hours,
on any of the preceding days, will be the most likely to <em>marry</em>&mdash;or
will, at least, have <em>Courtships</em> that will be likely to have a
happy termination.</p>

<p>We do not presume to assert that every lady born on the last-mentioned
times will be exempt from all descriptions of trouble
during the whole of their lives, but that they will never (in spite
of whatever may happen to befall them) sink below mediocrity.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
Even servants and those born of poor parents will possess some
superior qualities, get into good company, be much noticed by
their superiors, and will, in spite of any intervening difficulties,
establish themselves in the world, and rise much above their
sphere of birth.</p>

<p>It has often been recorded, and though a singular observation,
experience has shown it to be a true one, that some event
of importance is sure to happen to a woman in her thirty-first
year, whether single or married; it may prove for her good, or
it may be some great evil or temptation; therefore we advise
her to be cautious and circumspect in all her actions. If she is
a maiden or widow, it is probable she will marry this year. If
a wife that she will lose her children or her husband:&mdash;She will
either receive riches or travel into a foreign land: at all events,
some circumstance or other will take place during this remarkable
year of her life, that will have great effect on her future fortunes
and existence.</p>

<p>The like is applicable to men in their forty-second year, of
which so many instances have been proved that there is not a
doubt of its truth: Observe always to take a lease for an odd
number of years; even are not prosperous. The three first days
of the moon are the best for signing papers, and the first five
days as well as the twenty-fourth for any fresh undertaking.
But we cannot but allow that a great deal depends on our own
industry and perseverance, and by strictly discharging our duty
to God and man, we may often overcome the malign influence
of a bad planet, or a day marked as unlucky in the book of fate.</p>

<h2><a name="ST_AGNES_DAY" id="ST_AGNES_DAY">ST. AGNES’ DAY</a></h2>


<p class="center">(<em>Charm to know who your husband shall be.</em>)</p>

<p>Falls on the 21st of January: you must prepare yourself by a
twenty-four hours’ fast, touching nothing but pure spring water,
beginning at midnight on the 20th, to the same again on the
21st; then go to bed, and mind you sleep by yourself, and do
not mention what you are trying to any one, or it will break the
spell; go to rest on your left side, and repeat these lines three
times:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

<div class="indentbase">St. Agnes, be a friend to me,</div>
<div class="indentbase">In the gift I ask of thee;</div>
<div class="indentbase">Let me this night my husband see&mdash;</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>and you will dream of your future spouse: if you see more than
one in your dream, you will wed two or three times, but if you
sleep and dream not, you will never marry.</p>

<span class="smallfont">OR,</span><br />
<span class="largefont">BOOK OF FATE.</span></a></h2>


<p><em>The Oraculum is gifted with every requisite variety of response to
the following questions</em>:</p>

<p>1. Shall I obtain my wish?</p>

<p>2. Shall I have success in my
undertakings?</p>

<h3>HOW TO WORK THE ORACULUM.</h3>

<p>Make marks in four lines, one under another, in the following
manner, making more or less in each line, according to your
fancy:</p>

<p class="spacedchars">* * * * * * * * *</p>

<p class="spacedchars">* * * * * * * * * *</p>

<p class="spacedchars">* * * * * * * * * * *</p>

<p class="spacedchars">* * * * * * * * * * * *</p>

<p>Then reckon the number of marks in each line, and, if it be
<em>odd</em>, mark down one dot; if <em>even</em>, two dots. If there be more
than nine marks, reckon the surplus ones over that number
only, viz.:</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" summary="Star table" style="margin-left:0em">
<tr><td style="max-width:20em">The number of marks in the first line of the foregoing are <em>odd</em>;
therefore make one mark, thus</td><td class="starcenter">*</td></tr>
<tr><td>In the second, <em>even</em>, so make two, thus</td><td class="starcenter">* *</td></tr>
<tr><td>In the third, <em>odd</em> again, make one mark only</td><td class="starcenter">*</td></tr>
<tr><td>In the fourth, <em>even</em> again, two marks</td><td class="starcenter">* *</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>TO OBTAIN THE ANSWER.</h3>

<p>You must refer to <span class="smcap"><a href="#ORACULUM">The Oraculum</a></span>, at the top of which you
will find a row of dots similar to those you have produced, and
a column of figures corresponding with those prefixed to the
questions; guide your eye down the column at the top of which
you find the dots resembling your own, till you come to the
letter on a line with the number of the question you are trying,
then refer to the page having that letter at the top, and, on a line
with the dots which are similar to your own, you will find your
<em>answer</em>.</p>

should be worked, or any enterprise undertaken: Jan. 1, 2,

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to
date contact information can be found at the Foundation's web site and
official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

    Chief Executive and Director

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
